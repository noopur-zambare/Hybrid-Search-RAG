# Hybrid Search RAG

Hybrid Search RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an advanced technique in NLP that enhances generative models by integrating both dense and sparse retrieval methods. This hybrid approach improves the ability of the model to fetch relevant information from large datasets or knowledge bases, leading to more accurate and contextually aware responses.
